However, fluency is impacted by the unnatural phrasing 'close all kinds of fittings locks,' which is a direct and awkward translation of 'schließen...beschläge schlösser.' A more natural rendering would be something like 'include all kinds of hardware locks.' The original German sentence also has minor grammatical issues ('Berufs hersteller,' missing punctuation), which the translation mirrors structurally. Adequacy is good as the essential meaning is preserved."
