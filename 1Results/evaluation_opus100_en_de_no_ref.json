'fallen gelassen' is a non-idiomatic, overly literal calque of 'dropped'; the correct legal term is 'fallen gelassen' is incorrect, it should be 'fallen gelassen' is not used, proper terms are 'zurückgezogen' or 'fallen gelassen' in a legal context, but more naturally 'Die Anklage wird fallen gelassen' or '...wird fallengelassen'. 'gefeuert' is colloquial but acceptable. The sentence structure is awkward and unidiomatic; a more fluent version would be 'Die Anklage wird fallengelassen, und er wird gefeuert' or better 'Die Anklage wird fallengelassen und er wird entlassen.'"

While grammatically correct, the phrasing 'Die Anklage wird fallen gelassen' is understandable but not the most natural or common legal phrasing in German; 'Die Anklage wird fallengelassen' (as one word) or more idiomatically 'Die Anklage wird fallen gelassen' (with a space) is standard, but 'Die Anklage wird niedergeschlagen' or 'Die Anklage wird zurückgezogen' would be more typical. 'Gefeuert' is a common colloquial term for 'fired,' making the second clause natural. The overall score balances high adequacy with good, but not perfect, fluency."

'In die Welt gebracht' is a bit vague and not a direct match for 'made their way' (which implies introduction/spread). Adequacy: The translation omits the entire second sentence about new art schools and invited teachers, making it incomplete and a significant meaning loss. The first sentence's core idea is preserved but imprecisely rendered."
