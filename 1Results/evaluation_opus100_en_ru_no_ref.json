It accurately preserves the core meaning and intent of the original English phrase. The slight deduction in adequacy is because the English phrase 'a shooting' is a common, concise idiom for a shooting incident or attack, while the Russian 'стрельба' is a more general term for 'shooting' (the act). However, in this context, the meaning is perfectly clear and the translation is entirely appropriate."
